            <img src="./myphoto.jpg" alt="Ravi Boddapati" class="bio-photo">
            <p>Hello! My name is Ravi Boddapati, and I am currently in my second year of pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science and Engineering, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, at Vishnu Institute of Technology in Bhimavaram. Originally from Rajahmundry, I have always been fascinated by the complexities and innovations within the realm of technology. <br><br>

                Despite the personal loss of my father, B. Ramana, my mother, B. Satyavathi, has been a constant source of inspiration and support in my life. This familial strength propels me forward in my journey to explore and conquer the vast field of technology. <br><br>
                
                As a web developer, I am deeply passionate about creating and innovating on the web. My curiosity drives me to continuously learn and adopt new technologies, further enhancing my skills and abilities in web development. I believe in the power of technology to transform and improve our lives, and I am committed to contributing positively to this field. <br><br>
                
                If you wish to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out to me via email at 22pa1a4214@vishnu.edu.in or give me a call at 9010076453. I am always open to discussing new projects, ideas, or simply engaging in conversations about the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
